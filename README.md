# Streamlit-project

**Introduction**

A sales prediction app based on a machine learning model and built with Streamlit. This project is to know how to embed a model  into a web app with a user-friendly interface, Streamlit. The objective is to have an interface that makes it easier for users to interact with an ML model.

**Process**

The process begins with exporting the necessary items from the notebook, building an interface, importing the necessary items for modelling, and then writing the code to process inputs. The process can be summarized as:

Export machine learning items from notebook

Import the machine learning items into the app script

Build the interface

Write backend code to process inputs

Pass values through the interface

Recover these values in backend

Submit the processed values to the ML model to make the predictions

Process the predictions obtained and display them on the interface.


**Installation**

To setup and run this project you need to have Python3 installed on your system. Then you can clone this repo. At the repo's root, use the code from below which applies:

+WINDOWS
